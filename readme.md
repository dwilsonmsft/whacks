## Explanation
Many Microsoft employees use the word "whack" to describe slashes. Whether the whack is a front slash or backslash is dependent must be derived from context clues. This project started as a way to disambiguate between whacks, but quickly expanded into a general lexicon for the description of punctuation and other nonalphabetic characters.
